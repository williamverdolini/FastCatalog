            <p>The <i>Multi-attribute Search</i> is a very common functionality in e-commerce application.<br />
               In this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept" target="_blank">PoC</a>, I moved this functionality into NoSQL realm, using MongoDb and ElasticSearch as my landing databases.</p>
            <p>The idea to demonstrate is that this functionality could be effectively managed with NoSQL database, specially with those that are born to be used in "aggregation-based" functionalities. And ElasticSearch is one of those. <br />
            If you want to read more about this PoC, you can find my point of view and my thoughts in <a href="http://williamverdolini.github.io/FastCatalog.html" target="_blank">these series of posts</a>.</p>

            <p>Use the toolbar above to view "in action" the prototyped functionality in different NoSQL databases.</p>
